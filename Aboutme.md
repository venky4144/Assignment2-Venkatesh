***Venkatesh Guttikonda***

   I feel like, I ain't have any Intresting Facts But the people i met they will say I was an Introvert.But sometimes I was trying to Get social with new People But i don't know the reason why I can't involve with Strangers too Quickly.Even I regret about it sometimes.
   I completed My Under Grad in Electronics and Communication Engineering,But Later I picked Up a Completely Different stream of Work
   At those Hard times I have Crossed Many Hurdles for getting into Computers Side.But Now i feel that I can accquire more Knowledge than my prior Experience.
